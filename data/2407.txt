{{historical}}

I'm the main organizer of Wikipedia, a free, open content encyclopedia.
Please have a look, at http://www.wikipedia.com/ . I would be delighted if
you would link to it from

http://kidspenpals.about.com/cs/dictionaries/

We've got 10,000 articles, growing by 2,000 per month. It's pretty
amazing, really. Here is an article about it in the MIT Technology Review:

We're also soon going to be the subject of an article in the New York
Times.

Thanks!
