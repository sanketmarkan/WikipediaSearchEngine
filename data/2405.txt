OK, folks, what are some websites that get lots and lots of traffic, and which might link to us?  Ideas???

* Wired (no links; might take an article though)
* ZDNet (no links; might take an article though)
* [[Wikipedia:Building_Wikipedia_membership/About.com|About.com]]
* Slashdot articles could link to Wikipedia articles under a "Related links" section.

Links to lists of popular websites:
